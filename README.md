### Introduction

This project performs a comprehensive descriptive data analysis on animal shelter data obtained from [data.austintexas*gov](https://data.austintexas.gov/browse?q=animal). The data has been explored, analyzed, and visualized to uncover insights into the types of animals, their intake and outcome patterns, as well as their characteristics.

### Data Overview

The project began by importing and merging data from two datasets: [Austin Animal Center Intakes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm) and 
[Austin Animal Center Outcomes](Austin Animal Center Outcomes). The resulting dataset contains common columns such as 'Animal ID', 'Name', 'Animal Type', 'Breed', 'Color', 'DateTime', 'MonthYear', 'Intake Type', and 'Outcome Type'.
